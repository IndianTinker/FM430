# FM430
A 'digital' FM Radio built using TEA5767 and MSP430 !

This repository contains the code to the project on Energia.

The MSP430 Launchpad interacts with TEA5767 FM Module over I2C. 

Standalone operation is currently not supported and is the topic of discussion currently at [43oh.com forums](http://forum.43oh.com/topic/8515-wire-library-not-working-when-launchpad-powered-externally/)
